# Amazon Reviews Text Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying Amazon reviews into star ratings (1-5) using machine learning. We implement and compare three models: **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel**, and **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**. The goal is to preprocess the text, extract relevant features, train models, and evaluate their performance. (There is more models in the code there are the one that excustion time let me test due the deadline)

> Essentially, we are training machines to interpret human emotionsâ€”so they can misunderstand us just like people do.

main.py - Runs the full pipeline.
requirements.txt - Contains the necessary Python dependencies.
There not much for me to say here anymore I leave Up to excution thanks.
